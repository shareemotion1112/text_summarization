We propose FearNet, a brain-inspired system for incremental class learning that achieves state-of-the-art performance at incremental class learning on image (CIFAR-100, CUB-200) and audio classification (AudioSet) benchmarks. We use a brain-inspired dual-memory system in which new memories are consolidated from a network for recent memories inspired by the mammalian hippocampal complex to a network for long-term storage inspired by medial prefrontal cortex. We use a module inspired by the basolateral amygdala for determining which memory system to use for recall.
